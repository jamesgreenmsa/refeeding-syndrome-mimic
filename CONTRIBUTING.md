# Contributing to Refeeding Syndrome MIMIC-IV Analysis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## About This Project

This repository contains research code for a doctoral dissertation on refeeding syndrome identification in ICU patients using the MIMIC-IV database. The code is made publicly available to comply with MIMIC-IV data use requirements and to support scientific transparency and reproducibility.

## Types of Contributions Welcome

### Bug Reports
If you encounter issues running the code:
1. Check existing issues to avoid duplicates
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Python version and package versions
   - Error messages (if any)
   - Operating system

### Documentation Improvements
- Clarifications to setup instructions
- Additional examples
- Corrections to methodology documentation
- Improved code comments

### Code Enhancements
- Performance optimizations
- Better error handling
- Additional data quality checks
- Support for different MIMIC-IV versions

## Not Accepting

- Changes to core methodology (this is dissertation research with fixed methods)
- Alternative statistical approaches (beyond scope of this specific study)
- Non-MIMIC-IV data sources

## How to Contribute

### For Bug Reports and Suggestions
1. Open an issue on GitHub
2. Provide detailed information
3. Be patient - this is academic research code maintained part-time

### For Code Contributions
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes with clear commit messages
4. Add/update documentation as needed
5. Test your changes
6. Submit a pull request

## Code Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Include type hints where helpful
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Documentation
- Update README.md if adding features
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update docs/ files if changing methodology
- Include examples for new functionality

### Testing

- Verify backward compatibility
- Document any new dependencies

## Questions?

- For MIMIC-IV access questions: mimic-support@physionet.org
- For code/pipeline questions: Open an issue or email jg1984@shp.rutgers.edu
- For methodology questions: [PI contact information]

## Code of Conduct

### Our Standards
- Be respectful and professional
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Respect privacy and confidentiality (remember: MIMIC-IV contains patient data)

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment or discrimination
- Trolling or inflammatory comments
- Sharing protected health information (PHI)
- Attempting to re-identify patients in MIMIC-IV

### Enforcement
Violations may result in:
- Warning
- Temporary ban
- Permanent ban from project

Report concerns to: jg1984@shp.rutgers.edu

## MIMIC-IV Data Ethics

**CRITICAL:** If you contribute to this project, you MUST:
- Have your own approved MIMIC-IV access

- Never include identifiable information in issues or pull requests
- Comply with the MIMIC-IV Data Use Agreement

## Attribution

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- CONTRIBUTORS.md file
- Future publications (if substantial contribution)
- Release notes

## License

## Development Roadmap

### Potential Future Enhancements
- Expanded electrolyte monitoring
- Additional severity scores (SAPS, MEWS)
- Visualization tools for quality checks
- Automated data quality reports
- Support for MIMIC-III comparison

### Not Planned
- Real-time implementation (this is retrospective research)
- Non-MIMIC data sources
- Clinical decision support (this is research, not clinical software)

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for helping make this research more robust, transparent, and useful to the research community!
